# New Tech Industries (NTI) — Demo Frontend

This repository is a lightweight Next.js (app router) scaffold implementing the NTI marketing homepage layout requested (Hero, About, Vision/Mission, Timeline, Products, Facilities, Quality, Industries, Why Choose, Contact). It's styled with Tailwind CSS and uses Framer Motion for small animations. Components are implemented as React + TypeScript files and use placeholder images.

Note: This scaffold contains UI-only code. No backend is included — the contact form is a static placeholder.

Getting started (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev

# 3) Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

Developer notes:
- Framework: Next.js 14 (app dir)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Components: Simple, minimal; replace placeholder images in `/public` as needed

Next steps I can help with:
- Hook up a serverless contact endpoint or Formspree integration
- Add real images and asset optimization
- Improve SEO (Open Graph images, social previews)
- Add unit tests and CI pipeline
